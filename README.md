# 🌾 AI + Blockchain Crop Insurance System (BBCIS)

## 🚀 System Overview
A comprehensive crop insurance platform that combines AI-powered fraud detection, satellite monitoring, and blockchain transparency to provide fair and efficient crop insurance services.

## 🛡️ Anti-Fraud Mechanisms

### 1. **Multi-Layer Verification System**
- **Geo-tagging & Satellite Validation**: Every field is GPS-tracked and monitored via satellite imagery
- **Time-stamped Photo Evidence**: Farmers must upload photos at sowing, mid-season, and harvest
- **IoT Sensor Integration**: Real-time environmental data validation
- **AI Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning models identify suspicious patterns

### 2. **Fraud Detection Triggers**
- Multiple claims for same geo-location
- Inconsistent crop growth patterns vs satellite data
- Weather data mismatch with damage claims
- Suspicious timing of damage reports
- Historical fraud patterns from farmer profiles

### 3. **Blockchain Transparency**
- Immutable record of all transactions
- Smart contract-based automatic payouts
- Transparent audit trail for regulators
- Tamper-proof farmer profiles and claim history
